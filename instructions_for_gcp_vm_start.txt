To start your virtual machine (VM) instance on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you can follow these steps using the GCP Console:

1.  **Go to the Google Cloud Console:** Open your web browser and navigate to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  **Select your Project:** If you have multiple GCP projects, ensure you've selected the correct project from the dropdown menu at the top of the page.
3.  **Navigate to Compute Engine:** In the left-hand navigation menu, go to **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.
4.  **Locate your VM Instance:** You will see a list of your VM instances. Find the instance you want to start.
5.  **Start the VM Instance:**
    *   Check the checkbox next to the VM instance you want to start.
    *   At the top of the list, click the **START** button (it looks like a right-facing triangle or a play button).
6.  **Confirm:** Confirm your action if prompted.

Once the instance is started, it might take a few moments for all services (like Gunicorn and Nginx) to come online, especially if they are configured to start automatically on boot.

After starting the VM, you can try to access your website or use the SSH command again if needed.
